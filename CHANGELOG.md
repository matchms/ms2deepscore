and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2024-10-17

### Changed
- Switch linter (and linting style) from pylint + prospector to ruff [#240](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/240)
- Clearer documentation and naming to run training from existing splits [#239](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/239)

### Fixed
- Fixed one memory leak when running the `parameter_serch` function (there might be more though) [#243](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/243)

## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-07

### Fixed
- A bug of spectrum pair sampling during training was fixed. Due to this bug for each spectrum only one unique spectrum was sampled, even if multiple spectra were available. The bug was introduced with MS2Deepscore 2.0

### Changed
- The inchikey pair selection and data generator has been refactored. The new data generator results in a more balanced inchikey distribution. For details see [#232](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/232)
- dense layers are now build with leaky ReLU instead of ReLU [#222](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/222).
- The zenodo link to the latest model has been updated to a model trained using the new algorithm.

### Added
- Missing code documentation [#222](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/222).

## [2.0.0] - date...
Large scale expansion, revision, and restructuring of MS2Deepscore.

### Added
- Models are now build using PyTorch.
- Models have build-in GPU support (using pytorch).
- new `EmbeddingEvaluatorModel` (Inception Time CNN)
- new `LinearModel` for absolute error estimates
- new `MS2DeepScoreEvaluated` matchms-style score --> gives "score" and "predicted_absolute_error"
- Additional smart binning layer that can handle input of much higher peak resolution (not used as a default!)
- New validation concept --> all-vs-all scores for the validation spectra are computed, but loss is then computed per score bin. This gives better and more significant statistics of the model performance
- New loss functions "Risk Aware MAE" and "Risk Aware MSE" which function similar to MAE or MSE but try to counteract the tendency of a model to predict towards 0.5.
- Losses can now be weighted with a weighting_factor.


### Changed
- No longer supports Tensorflow/Keras
- The concept of Spectrum binning has changed and is now implemented differently (i.e. no more "missing peaks" as before)
- Monte-Carlo Dropout does not return a score (mean or median) together with percentile-based upper and lower bound (instead of STD or IQR before).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-12

Last version using Tensorflow. Next versions will be using PyTorch.

### Added
- Added split_positive_and_negative_mode.py [#148](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/148)
- Added SettingMS2Deepscore [#151](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/151)
- Clearer Warnings when too little input spectra are used in data generator. [#155](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/issues/155)

### Changed
- Change the max oversampling rate to max_pairs_per_bin [#148](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/148)
- Made spectrum pair selection a lot simpler and fixed mistake [#148](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/148)
- Use DataGeneratorCherrypicked instead of DataGeneratorAllInchikeys in pipelines [#148](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/148)
- Removed M1 Chip compatibility which lead to faulty results depending on Tensorflow version [#200](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/200)

   
## [0.5.0] - 2023-08-18

### Added

- New `DataGeneratorCherrypicked` as alternative to former data generators [#145](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/145). This will work better for large datasets and also tried to counteract biases in the chemical similarity scores.
- Models can now be trained on selected metadata entries in addition to the spectrum peaks [#128](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/128).
- New `MetadataFeatureGenerator` class to handle additional metadata more robustly [#128](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/128)
- Workflow scripts for training a new MS2DeepScore model [#124](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/124). The ease of training MS2Deepscore models is improved, including standard settings and splitting validation and training data.

### Changed

- In SiameseModel, the attributes are not passed as an argument but instead used by the class.
- Improved plotting functionality. Some additional plotting options were added and plots previously created in notebooks are now functions.
- Linting (code and imports) [#145](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/pull/145).
